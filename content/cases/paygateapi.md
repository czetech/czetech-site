# PHP library according to exact specifications

Slovak State Treasury implemented [payment gateway](https://metais.vicepremier.gov.sk/detail/ISVS/7a20cf80-9503-4253-b12f-817e3c5f7ef0/cimaster).

## Solution

As a subcontractor, we have supplied PHP client library to access the payment gateway API and the appropriate manual.

## Results

Treasury customers can easily implement a payment gateway API into their PHP applications.

## Open-source contribution

Due to the nature of the client library, the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/czetech/paygateapi-php).
